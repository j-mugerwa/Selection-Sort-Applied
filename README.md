# Selection-Sort-Applied
 In this repo, we try to demonstrate the application of the selection sort Algorithm to devices competing for bandwith in a networking environment. The algorithm ensures that the bandwidth is assigned from the least demand to the biggest.

 # How it works
1- User selects the number of devices (from 3 to 20).

2- Press "Generate Devices", and a list of devices with random bandwidth requests appears.

3- Press "Optimize Bandwidth Allocation", and the Selection Sort algorithm sorts devices in ascending order (devices needing the least bandwidth get priority).

4- The sorted list appears in green, showing optimal bandwidth allocation.


# Real-World Relevance
ðŸ”¹ Fair Bandwidth Distribution: Low-bandwidth devices get served first, avoiding starvation.

ðŸ”¹ Optimized Network Resource Usage: Ensures no device consumes excessive bandwidth before others get served.

ðŸ”¹ Prevention of Congestion: Helps in traffic shaping by prioritizing lightweight network flows first.
